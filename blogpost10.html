	<h1> things are awful and show no signs of getting better but i still hope things will get better! </h1>
	<p>hi guys!! update time, things are bad, yesterday sucked. everyone yelled at me, i dont like it when i get yelled at :( i did fix this sweet old man's printer yesterday! that made me happy :) i also got super cheap udon ($5 for a bowl! isn't that crazy?) it was so delicious, but after that everything sucked, my boss said he'd pay me extra if i went someplace really far for a client, so i went, on the way a car ran over a puddle that i was walking past and i got really wet and sad, but the lady i was dealing with was really nice <strong> at first. </strong> she apologized for having to book the repair so late and she put my jacket infront of a heater, then she told me the problem (windows shut down during update, nothing worked) so i told her im backing up whatever files she needed and im wiping the computer to reinstall windows, she said "yup! thats okay!" i backed everything up and then when her computer was working again she started getting really passive aggressive because she couldnt remember her login details for work (and that's my problem) and when i tried to explain things to her she got really aggro and started yelling at me, she later apologized in like a passive aggressive way like "oh im sorry it's just im really fucked now" like okay?? i spend 2 hours trying to fix her computer and her copier and recover her account for her and she was super mean and ungrateful, i even fixed some of her wifi issues but she just kept yelling at me and was being a total bitch, i sent the invoice so she could pay and left because being in that house made me sad, i then get a call from my boss asking why she hasn't payed? which was confusing because she told me she did, i then called her asking whats up and this mean old lady starts SCREAMING AT ME (just a little guy) about how invoices aren't payed immediately in the real world and how i should be less demanding (I ASKED IN A VERY KIND NICE WAY) so now my boss is yelling at me and this lady is yelling at me and there's a chance im not getting paid for the most fucking annoying job of my life, and now i have to commute an hour and a half to get home in the rain (i got home at 9:30) just so another car would run over a puddle next to me and my parents would yell at me, and all i could think about on the commute was how much i miss my ex, i cried until i threw up, it was so awful, and being at home sucks, but im optimistic going forward! im applying for a tafe so i can start university early and stuff, my mom is really upset at me because i made fun of her for dropping out of university 6 times, honestly i dont care, im so funny, i laughed for 20 minutes straight at my own jokes, but now she's getting really pissy and mean, i dont care though, that old lady kind of reminds me of my mom lol, ive been dropping alot of hobbies after my ex stopped talking to me, things just kind of dont have the same charm anymore, i used to be really into film, id watch 2 movies everyday for a while, now i cant sit myself down to watch 5 minutes of a film/series, i feel sick when i do it, same with my video games and books, my yotsubato and punpun is BEGGING to get read but i just cant force myself to do it, i dont like going out anymore which i used to enjoy and i also dont like being at home, thats okay though, its whatever i guess, i still have my cat, i love cuddling her, shes very warm and cute :3 i need to update the kitty cat page on my site to have more pictures of her. i think when i finish uni ill go to japan, i heard japanese employers are super eager to hire foriegners, theres a thing called the meti internship program or something, the japanese government flys you out to japan, gives you free accomodation, food, a phone and a job with an allowance of 3000 yen daily, id love that. id love anything that'd let me leave this shithole. recently ive grown to hate this country and city, its so boring, theres nothing for me here, living in melbourne makes you restless yet sleepy, theres nothing for me here but a dead end job and a mortgage ill never realistically pay off, maybe if im lucky a loveless marriage, i need to leave ASAP or ill be stuck forever</p>
