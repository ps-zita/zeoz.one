	<h1>WE'RE SO FUCKING BACK GUYS !!!!!</h1>
	<p>HEY !!!!!!! hi guys :3 since last time things got a little worse, and then ALOT BETTER! we're so fucking back. what's weird is that there was no reason for
things to get worse, nor is there a reason things got better, but im grateful. the past 3 or 4 days ive been sick, but as of writing this im like %95
recovered. i found this girl on this weird like sns/dating kind of app, and she's SO COOL! i know i said id work on myself before looking for someone, but 
this time i feel like im the best i could be, AND i can totally make an exception for this girl, she's so awesome, she COSPLAYS?!?!?!?!? which is so so kewl,
she likes AZUMANGA DAIOH!!!!!!! AND LUCKY STAR!!!!! AND EVANGELION!!!! AND PERSONA!!!! AND CHAINSAWMAN!!!!SHE ENDS WORDS WITH -pill, -core, -cell and -coded.
we share so much in common, i cant wait to like watch azumanga daioh and play resident evil with her. she even cosplayed rise which i did not believe at
first, like how can someone be that cool. i made plans to go out with her and we wouldve gone out yesterday, but i felt really sick so we cancelled, that 
was super disappointing at first, especially since im gonna be busy for like the next 5 days, but thats fine, i can be patient, i hope things go well with
her, i would talk about her alot more but there's gonna be a chance she reads this and i dont wanna seem like crazy obsessive and fucking mental, but yeah
guys!!!!!!!  in terms of job hunting im still jobless, but i dont really care as much, i still get by in terms of money, im coolin im chillin. in 5 days im
going to this fighting game thingy, i cant wait!! my fingers hurt from practicing tekken combos and sf3 parries, but yeah!!! im so happy i hope this never
ends i dont want to go back to sad upset cry zeo episode, oh and in terms of self harm ive been clean for like !!! i dont even remember how many months,
but its been alot, same with tobacco, but the tobacco thing wasnt really an addiction in the first place. ehh this blog post is kind of short i dont really
know what to talk about, but i felt like updating you guys, sorry if this was poorly written i am very sleepypilled.
