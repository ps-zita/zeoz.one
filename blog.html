	<h3>things are getting better!</h3>
	<a>3.22.23. I'm feeling alot happier! I feel like my mental wellbeing has been in a somewhat inconsistent state of happiness and sadness, but hopefully things are looking up now. as of now I have a really cute girlfriend! (pictured below) and I'm planning on hanging out more often with my friends, as well as consistently working out and keeping myself occupied, I'm also seeking a second job in the hopes of keeping myself occupied, I hope I can maintain this happiness consistently because I've found it really difficult to do so in the past.</a>

	<h3>dating.</h3>

	<p>3.18.23. as of recently ive been attempting to put myself out there, and for the most part its been pretty horrible, i end up either feeling extremely uncomfortable on most of the dates or (rarely) really clicking with someone and not having them reciprocate or share feelings :/ i kind of feel like i dont want to try anymore. but its okay, i just need to power through i guess. <br> **EDIT if you are living anywhere in melbourne, feel free to contact me! not even as a romantic interest just as a friend, I'm pretty lonely.</p>
