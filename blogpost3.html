	<p>apologies if the grammer here is bad or anything is incomprehensible, i just had alot of shit on my mind that i needed to say, love you guys ♥ ♥  </p>
	<h1> dumb fucking rant lol </h1>
	<p>i really felt like making a blogpost today despite not really having anything to say,
i still feel lonely and sad and everything (╥﹏╥) i did start this blogpost off as like
a review on shin megami tensei; digital devil saga, but im not really feeling it anymore.
im trying to go on dates but when conversations are like going well with a girl and we're
really hitting it off she starts to like ghost me? like i ask if she wants to go out and
she's like "yeah totally! it sounds fun!" and then when i ask for a date to confirm she
usually ends up saying "yeah let me check when im free" and just does not get back to me
 :( why lead me on like this? can't you just say "no thanks" or something :/ but whatever
i think putting all my energy into finding a partner is starting to get really bad for me,
but also not having a partner is getting really bad for me so its like what???? what am i
supposed to do, lying down rn the way i cant fucking STAND these bitches.
also im unemployed again, i had this really cool job offer in the west that I could've
gotten, so i quit both my jobs only for my employer to tell me they made a last second
decision not to employ me :( like what the fuck dude? fucking asshole.
so im jobless and penniless again :C and im applying to a bunch of new places but its
hard. its like ive worked so hard to make things better for myself and nothing happened,
and just as fast as things had gotten better for me, things got worse, i have nothing and
noone anymore except for my cat, a ps2 and this dumb fucking website, and its so depressing
at home, i want to get away so fucking badly, i want to move out immediately and honestly,
if i got a job i probably could, minimum wage and not working much hours at all is more then
enough for a sharehouse or maybe some wealthy couple's poolhouse/shed, but of course my
parents wouldn't let that happen (not that that's a bad thing) i think the issue is just me
yearning for independence, yearning for something new, i just want out, i want to get the
fuck away from here man. i genuinely think me working a 9-5 living in a cheap ass studio
would be heaven compared to this, like there's something telling me that i WILL be happy as
soon as i gain independence, so i could like have control over my life, ive had adults tell
me that adulting is hard and so much worse, but i think its just a them thing, like that's
their problem, i think for me it'll be different.
my parents are telling me im not allowed to sleep in another house until i get married, but
maybe i dont want to get married? maybe i only seek a partner because it feels like a step
towards independence or it feels good or something, maybe they wont approve of the girl i 
want to marry, what if i try to marry someone i dont love so i can leave this shithole.
i dont want to be in my mid-late 20s or 30s at my parents house, id rather die.
honestly i see myself marrying someone i dont love so i could live on my own with someone,
it seems like a me thing, it seems like something i'd do, i definitely wouldnt be surprised.
i mean nothing is stopping me from moving out, at least until i turn 18. i could just pack
my shit and go and they cant do anything about it, except maybe be disappointed or dislike
me or something, which i guess i dont like, but would it be worth it? i dont know how i
manage to spend a whole day here, let alone the next 10 years lol (if i even get married by
then) maybe ill do uni/college in a foriegn country or state, i know i wont be able to make
the commute overseas every morning and night lmao
i guess im doing alot better then i was like a year ago, like i dont want to kill myself or
anything, so i guess i have that going for me? i should stop being a lil bitch. i have so
much to be grateful for, this blogpost shit is making me feel a little better bout things
though so thats cool.
