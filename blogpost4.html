	<h1>IM !! SO!! FUCKING!! HAPPY AHHH!!</h1>
	<p>hey guys! today im feeling extremely happy. i dont know why! its so weird, its almost euphoric, last night i was so sad, i was tearing up and screaming in my
pillow, but when i woke up today i felt amazing. i woke up to sunrise and it was so beautiful outside, the sky was pink and purple ^_^ it was so cute!!
its so weird being this happy, i feel optimistic for the future and just !!! really happy wtf?? i looked at myself in the mirror today and i felt suuper cute
and handsome and sexy >:) ive lost alot of weight and im super happy with how im built !! my muscles are getting bigger and AHH!! i feel like ive fallen in
love with someone (despite me being as lonely as ever) i tried something new with my hair, my dad said it looked cool which made me smile. I love him sooo
much. my friend gave me some advice about putting all my energy into finding a partner, how its hurting me and i need to work on myself before i find comfort
in anyone else, i was skeptical at first because im so lonely, but im taking that advice as of today, i even blew off a date with some girl im not even that
interested in (im supposed to be on that date as of writing this, lmao) i think ill still go out eventually but ill also start caring less, i also smell
amazing right now. so so amazing. i put on my favorite perfume and i can still smell the lavenderish shampoo that i used, i feel so amazing! im planning on
printing some resumes and cover letters out to hand out in person!! i hope i can find a job soon! im also going to play just a teensy bit of tekken at the
youth club today, last time they kicked me off because i was winning too much hehe, on the 25th this month im going to a fighting game meetup in the city!
im super duper excited :3 i cant wait to meet cool people and play some street fighter and guilty gear! my favorite characters are bridget and akuma(gouki).
me being so happy is so crazy because two days ago i feel like my mental state was the worst its been in a while, im so so soooo happy!!! i dont know why 
roflcopter.. im feeling so toasty in all my layers of clothes, it feels like a big hug. i think ill visit my dad at work today and ill buy him a gift or
something, like some pineapple soda or twinkies. i feel like typing more but ive ran out of stuff to say, so ill cya later guys, love youuuu
