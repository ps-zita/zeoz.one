	<h1> things are okay.</h1>
	<p>hi everyone! long time since last blogpost, sorry about that, had nothing meaningful to say. i love yall <br>
everything is okay i guess, i feel awful, everyone around me feels awful, and it seems like there's no end in sight, this feeling will pass. im not sure when
though, i hope soon, and i hope everyone that is feeling awful at the moment (including you, dear reader) begins healing soon.
<br> this morning i watched "All About Lily Chou Chou" i really liked it, this blogpost is not a movie review, i really want to make one, so keep your eyes
peeled for when i do, i also read chainsawman, chapters 129-131, it was very cool, i have nothing too profound to say about it since it was only 30 pages,
but ill be sure to talk about volume 12 of chainsawman as a whole when its completed in july, i also bought myself a copy of "goodnight, punpun" im almost
finished with it, again be sure to keep your eyes peeled for a review/my experiences with reading it, but im really enjoying it so far, buying it was
embarassing though because my card initially declined, i had to deposit withdraw some cash and pay for it mostly with loose change (like $10 worth of coins
and $25 of actual cash lol) it wasnt even like $2 coins, it was like bunches of 20c and 50c coins it was so embarassing, i could barely afford it too, but 
it was definitely worth it! this blogpost has been a short one, but i have plans for what im going to write about, and also plans for the overall aesthetic
of the website, thanks for being patient and waiting a month, ily guys <3
