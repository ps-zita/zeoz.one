	<h1> optimism yippee ^_^ (things are bad but im trying to be as happy as i can about it!) </h1>
	<p>hi everyone! things have been pretty sucky but im staying optimistic !! i was about to move out and save for a bond for an apartment because i was sick of being treated like a burden and liability, i ended up not moving forward with it because i was being pretty impulsive and renting a place out is a BAD IDEA!! especially with what little money i make, after rent (utils included) for the place i was interested in, i would probably have like $50 left over for groceries for the month. which is pretty sad :( i was thinking of picking up a second job though, and if stuff gets worse here ill probably end up leaving, yesterday i actually felt quite happy for the first time in a while, i had an insane amount of fun at work and afterwards i ended up dicking around in chapel street all day, before work i even explored some parts of my city that i havent seen before or havent seen in a very long time! and before i went home i got some fried jerk chicken ,,,, holy fuckign shit dude ,,,,, what ! that chicken was the best chicken i have ever had ever before man it was fucking WILD bruh shit was amazing !!! im not very stressed about the exams i have coming up because i studied and i understand all my material but everyone around me is, some people arent talking to me because they're too anxious or too busy and i get it, but its kind of bumming me out because i miss all of you <3 i was about to take some entrance exams to these pretentious fancy high schools but i ended up not doing that because my mama said that it would just be a waste of money. that kind of fucked with me for a while tbh, in retrospect giving up because she was being an ass about it is just letting her win, but also partially because i couldnt be fucked studying for entrance exams LMAO also im happy with what i have going on with this school, also !! im starting my own business kind of!! ill hand my clients business cards (seen below) and i have my own awesome website for it (domain isnt bought yet, https://ps-zita.github.io/katzecomputer/ ) how my work normally works is that a company outsources their work to my boss, and my boss gives me the work, so im cutting out the middle man and his middle man by just providing my services directly! thanx 4 reading this one today, luv ya guys
