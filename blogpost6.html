	<h1> i give up</h1>
	<p>hey guys :( its been a while since ive last posted, the last 2 weeks have probably been the most amazing 2 weeks of my life, but again, when things got bad
they got REALLY bad, the higher you are the further you fall or whatever, i keep trying to make things better for myself even though i KNOW things are going
to get so much worse afterwards, i should be content with my shitty miserable existence so i wont make things worse for myself. im finding this somewhat hard
to write about since i have nothing to look forward to, nothing to be happy about, nothing at all. i feel like ive lost everything that matters to me now,
and everything that has mattered to me before no longer matters to me now, i need to stop being vulnerable, i need to stop opening up, i need to stop.
i need to stop caring i need to stop loving i need to stop !!! right now to make myself not want to commit suicide ive been reading lots of yotsuba and
listening to silly vocaloid music :3 i almost strangled myself with my belt last night, not too proud of that, it wont happen again most likely, maybe this
is a good experience, im walking in as a pathetic little shit and walking out grown up and more cynical or whatever, but most likely im trapped in this cycle
of desperation and envy and i just ache for love so badly, i still do after being hurt like this time and time again, in another month expect a blogpost
titled "IM IN LOVE!" and followed up with "im going to kill myself" or "its so over" or something, whatever, fuck it, maybe life is worth living for those
2 weeks of happiness, maybe im fine with getting progressively worse for those small moments of euphoria, until one day its not worth it, then what? fuck it
lmao fuck it im just gonna read yotsuba and have a little cry and smoke or vape or whatever i can get my hands on **small little tangent on vapes, i dont get
it, i dont see the appeal, i fucking hate it dude, ive went in with an open mind and each time im just pretty disappointed, its just an unenjoyable subpar
experience to me, anyway back on track um, fuck dude im pretty sad right now.
