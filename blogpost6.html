	<h1> i give up </h1>
	<p>i came across a draft of a blogpost i wrote yesterday, i think this will be my final blog. i give up. i fucking give up i cant take it anymore. im going to 
give up im miserable im sad i cannot tolerate this anymore, whats the point, being consistently happy just makes the downfall so much worse, i give up, ill
rot in my bed forever and never leave, i dont care anymore. i dont care anymore. i dont care anymore. the only happiness ill come to know and understand from
this moment forth will be from fiction and dreams, i cant fucking do this anymore, if i werent religious i wouldve killed myself a long time ago, im not even
praying things get better im praying my end comes soon. i want a cigarette so badly, i have not felt this horrible in so long, i knew it i got scared this
would happen and i knew id react this way but im a fucking retard and i keep gambling, seeing if things work out differently, ive done it in the past and it
always ends up the same, im sick of it all. im sick of it. i was so happy when i drafted that last blogpost, i fucking cant anymore why why i was so happy
all day cant things work out why
