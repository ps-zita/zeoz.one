    <h1>things are getting better! but I feel so much worse :( </h1>
    <p>the past month I have done EVERYTHING I possibly could have done to make myself happy. <br> 
I studied hard, started working two jobs, prayed more often, worked out more, went out with friends more, and I have so much to be grateful for, so I genuinely cannot FATHOM why I feel the way I feel, I guess at the moment I am really missing my closest friend right now, but otherwise I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do now, what next step do I take? and now it feels like I've grown to hate all my hobbies aswell, I hate all my books, all my video games, this web design bullshit, all my tech bullshit, I hate it all. It's okay though, I've felt like this before so I'm just waiting to get over it.</p>
