      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm a 15-year-old tech enthusiast based in the southeastern region of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. As a hobby, I enjoy repairing broken computers, laptops, and gaming consoles. Although I don't primarily do it for money, it helps me fund my hobby. I'm interested in fighting games such as Street Fighter 3, 5, and eagerly awaiting the release of Street Fighter 6. Additionally, I enjoy playing Tekken and Smash Brothers, as well as non-competitive games like Max Payne, Unreal Tournament, and Half-Life 1 & 2. I'm a fan of Zelda and excited about the upcoming release of "Tears of the Kingdom." When it comes to TV shows, I enjoy watching the "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul" duology. While I'm not a massive fan of anime and manga, I do enjoy watching them occasionally, especially older and classic essential ones like "Cowboy Bepop, Fooly Cooly, Serial Experiments Lain, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Lucky Star, Nichijou, Azumangah Daioh, Death Note, Chainsawman, Berserk," among others. As for music, my taste varies widely and includes shoegaze, DNB, soul, hip-hop, indie rock bands, and more.
