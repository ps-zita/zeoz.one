      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Ziad, I'm 15 and I'm based around south east part of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. </p>
      <p>I'm a tech enthusiast, right now as a hobby I like to buy broken computers, laptops, video game consoles and other things in an attempt to repair and sell them, in reality I dont do it to make money, its more so I can afford this rather expensive hobby. Right now I'm really into fighting games like Street Fighter 3, 5, and I'm excited for Street Fighter 6, I also am enjoying the Tekken and Smash Brothers franchises, In terms of non competitive games I do find myself enjoying older titles especially more recently, with me now enjoying Max Payne, Unreal Tournament and Half Life 1 & 2, I also really enjoy Zelda and I'm super excited for the release of "Tears of the Kingdom." I'm also really into the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona franchise, outside of tech and video games I also really enjoy basketball, (I'm a Sixers fan) and I'm making more of an effort excersising more often, I also enjoy film & literature, my favourite book right now is "Down and out in Paris and London" and my all time favourite tv show series are the "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul" duology, I'm not SUPER into anime and manga however I do find myself enjoying it often, just not as much as most people, I tend to like older more classic essential anime/manga, with some exceptions, my favourite all time anime and manga would be "Cowboy Bepop, Fooly Cooly, Serial Experiments Lain, Neon Genisis Evangelion, Lucky Star, Nichijou, Azumangah Daioh, Death Note, Chainsawman, Berserk and others that I have forgotten about as of writing this, as for music my taste varies ALOT and I've dipped my toes into alot of genres, right now im into shoegaze, DNB, soul, hiphop, indie rock bands and some other stuff</p>
