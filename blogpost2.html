	<h1>loneliness :( </h1>
	<p>Hi everyone! It's been a while since my last update, and that's mostly because things have been the same since last time. One big difference is that I'm trying really hard to put myself out there and find a partner, but it's been extremely difficult.</p>
	<p>All dates I've been on have resulted in either me not finding this person easy to talk to and just not enjoying the date in general, or me really enjoying the date but not having the other person reciprocate and share feelings, and in the end, it always leaves me really upset. So upset that I thought I'd just be better off not trying, but it's not as simple as that. There's something so addictive about it, just the thought of having someone and being with someone, sharing a monogamous relationship with longevity and content is just really cozy. I am planning on going on a date with someone soon; she seems real cool. I really hope this date turns out well because I really like her.</p>
	<p>I want to take her to a cafe, then an arcade, and afterwards this secret exit that leads you out to a rooftop where you get a great view of the city. I really want to wow her with something really well planned out.</p>
	<p>Oh also, I found out I'm autistic, which is cool, I guess. It explains quite a lot, actually. </p> <p> I've been getting really upset whenever I come across a happy couple, both in real life and in fiction. Love songs make me upset, TV shows with a happy couple make me upset, so do movies, as well as happy couples in public.</p>
	<p>Once I had to buy a VGA cable at a dollar store, but there was a couple kissing in the aisle I had to buy the cables at, so I just fucking left lol. Didn't wait for them to go, didn't ask them to move, I just groaned (audibly) and left. Ngl, in retrospect, shit was mad funny. I'm a funny lil dude, I think. Women should love me.</p>
