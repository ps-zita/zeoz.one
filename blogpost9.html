	<h1> obligatory bi-monthly blogpost about heartbreak </h1>
	<p>holy shit guys this is the worst it has ever been! oh my fuckingg goddd i was so in love wwith her. i NEED her i am goig insane guys!!1!! i miss her so much, i broke down crying at work the other day, ive grown to hate the things that usually make me happy in times like this (going to the city, working, video games etc) and i cant listen to alot of my favorite music without thinking of her, nor watch any movies i like, i havent touched punpun since she left because she's the one that reccomended it to me and it makes me think of her alot !!! i dream of her alot and i get really sad alot now, she was like the only good thing going for me and the only person that kept me consistently happy, one of the only three people i could trust and she deserted me and left me like how she said she never would've done, out of the many times this has happened to me by far this hurts the most. <br> i keep telling myself she'll take me back when she's in a better state mentally because i was so good to her, i think i was? we inherently love each other because of our interests and how similar we are, how much we shared in common, am i being delusional? i feel like dying. i wish she'd just kill me instead because id get to die in her arms and i wouldnt die alone, i miss her. ill never find anyone like her ever again in my life, im still in love with her and ill love her forever !! im being very pathetic right now but i feel like anyone would be given they had someone who was so similar to themself, so kind and sweet and funny, so pretty, i feel horrible. i was saving to take us on a weekend trip :( to like bendigo or geelong or something, i was so excited, i love her so much guys. i dont know who im writing this to anyway she was like the only one that would read this shit, and now shes gone. i keep seeing happy couples in public and i feel like screaming at them, i PRAY they break up and i hope its fucking DEVASTATING. like who the fuck takes you on a date to a kmart at 11am on a tuesday??? i dont want to be miserable anymore. i just want her back and everything will be okay again
